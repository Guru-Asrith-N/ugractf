### A messenger 

opened the challenge  
extracted text from image  
ran it in cipher analyser  
didn't get anything  
saw in discord about pap  
searched and found that PAP full form was protected area permit  
it was not relevent to the question   
in discord it was the symbol on the image is an organisation image and it was in the game papers, please  
after reading through the information of Ezic in fandom, found a dedcoder at the bottom of the page   
we should place the decoder on top of the image to get the required text   
placed it on top of the text and found only part of the code   
went to discord and understood that the key should be placed on 2 locations to get the full key   
saw in the fandom that the key should be placed on 4 dots in the cipher 2 at a time  
found the flag  
```
flag - ugra[snowier_pastures_2ssijezl]
